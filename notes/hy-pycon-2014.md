I gave a talk this year at [PyCon 2014](https://us.pycon.org/2014/), about one
of my favorite subjects: [Hy](http://hylang.org/). Many of my regular readers
will have no doubt explored Hy's thriving
[GitHub org](http://github.com/hylang), played with
[try-hy](http://try-hy.appspot.com/), or even installed it locally by
[pip installing it](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/hy). I was lucky enough to
be able to attend PyCon on behalf of [Sunlight](http://sunlightfoundation.com/),
with a solid contingent of my colleagues. We put together a writeup on the
[Sunlight blog](http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2014/04/18/sunlight-at-pycon-2014/)
if anyone was interested in our favorite talks.

Tons of really amazing questions, and such an amazingly warm reception from
so many of my peers throughout this year's PyCon. Thank you so much to
everyone that attended the talk. As always, you should
[Fork Hy on GitHub](https://github.com/hylang/hy),
follow [@hylang](https://twitter.com/hylang) on the twitters, and
send in any bugs you find!

Hopefully I'll be able to put my talk up in blog-post form soon, but until then
feel free to look over the [slides](http://slides.pault.ag/hy.html) or just
[watch the talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmMaN1AokTI).

An extra shout-out to [@akaptur](https://twitter.com/akaptur) for hacking on
Hy during the sprints, and giving the exception system
[quite the workthrough](https://github.com/hylang/hy/pull/556).
Thanks, Allison!
